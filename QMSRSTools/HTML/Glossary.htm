                        top. Each possibility is then rated on a numeric scale of importance or effectiveness
                        (e.g. on a scale of 1 to 10) for each criterion, and each rating is recorded in
                        the appropriate box. When all ratings are complete, the scores for each possibility
                        are added to determine which has the highest overall rating and thus deserves the
                        greatest attention.</p>

                        Metacraftsmanship is a term used to tie together the many ideas shared by quality
                        improvement, reengineering, management, leadership, and customer-driven production.
                        Although these theories have much in common, they are often treated as separate
                        and disparate approaches to improving a business. Metacraftsmanship focuses on overcoming
                        the losses to society which are engendered by specialization, and suggests ways
                        of getting complex organizations to work the way a single craftsman would.</p>

                        in machinery performance, in variations in the quality of human factors, etc.</p>

                    <p>
                        The idea that a few root problems are responsible for the large majority of consequences.
                        The Pareto principle is derived from the work of Vilfredo Pareto, a turn-of-the-century
                        Italian economist who studied the distributions of wealth in different countries.
                        He concluded that a fairly consistent minority, about 20% of people, controlled
                        the large majority, about 80% of a society's wealth. This same distribution has
                        been observed in other areas and has been termed the Pareto principle. It is defined
                        by J.M. Juran as the idea that 80% of all effects are produced by only 20% of the
                        possible causes.</p>

                    <p>
                        An algebraic function that illustrates the loss of quality that occurs when a characteristic
                        deviates from its target value. It is expressed often in monetary terms. Dr. Genichi
                        Taguchi coined this term; his work suggests that quality losses vary as the square
                        of the deviation from target.</p>

                        Dr. Deming cautions against tampering with systems that are "in control." It is
                        very common for management to react to variation which is in fact normal, thereby
                        starting wild goose chases after sources of problems which don't exist. Tampering
                        with stable processes actually increases variation.</p>
